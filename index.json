Due to Coronavirus, campus is closed, and the rest of semester is now online, here is the schedule for les Mathematics:\nDear Math 1180 students, First of all, let me say that this is going to be fine. I have the following revised schedule for what we will be doing for the rest of the term. Some explanations are below. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + Alternate Schedule for Math 1180: + +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Monday, March 23: - Test 3 over chapter 5 and sections 6.1,6.2,6.3 will be posted Monday, March 30: - Test 3 is Due - Start Section 6.4 Wednesday, April 1: - Section 6.5 Friday, April 3: - Section 7.1 Monday, April 6: - Work from sections 6.4, 6.5, 7.1 is due - Section 7.2 Wednesday, April 8 - Section 7.3 Friday, April 10 - Section 7.4 Monday, April 13 - Section 7.5 Wednesday, April 15 - Get Test 4 Friday, April 17 - Test 4 is due - Start Section 10.1 Monday, April 20 - Section 10.2 Wednesday, April 22 - Section 10.3 Friday, April 24 - Section 10.4 Monday, April 27 - Work from sections 10.1 – 10.4 is due Wednesday, April 29 - Get test 5 Friday, May 1 - Test 5 is due Monday, May 4 - Get the final exam Friday, May 8 - Final Exam is due  Tests:  You will be testing at home. I will post the test on D2L and attach it to an email. If you have a printer at home you can print the test and work it as you would in class.\nThen you can send me what you have done by either scanning or email. I will be grading you on the completeness, correctness, and clarity of your work and I’ll be a bit merciless about this. You’ll get your first test on March 23 and it will be due on March 30. If you don’t have a printer you can just write the problems on separate paper and send those to me.\nHomework:  I don’t think I’m going to be able to look at all of the homework.\nI can’t think of a good way to get it from you. I will just make extra sure that the tests reflect the homework.\nLecture:  Our regular classroom is a classroom-capture room. That means there is a camera in the room that will record everything that happens there. I’ve asked that the camera be turned on so that you can access the recordings of those lecture whenever you want. I’ll be lecturing to an empty classroom, which will be thrilling for me, but you’ll be able to see it from home. There will be a link in D2L to get to the recording. I’ll keep doing that as long as I can have access to the room. If at some point I no longer have access, I will replace these lectures with some YouTube videos that I will make as well as lots of written explanations of what we are doing.\nGroup-work:  Of course you’re not going to be able to work in groups and still maintain social distancing. I will, however, ask you to do some work in groups of one (that’s by yourself) and send that to me.\nThere will be more information coming soon. Stay tuned. If you have any questions at all you can email me as often as you like.\n"

	"content": " SQL Basics What is a database exactly? To put it simply, it’s a computer program which stores various data. There are quite a few database vendors, e.g., Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and many others.\nThere are various types of databases. In this course, we’re going to focus on relational databases - they’re a very frequent choice in the contemporary IT world.\nRelational Databases: Every relational database stores information in tables. You can have many tables in one database and each of your tables will hold data which refers to similar objects. Each tables has a name. So you can find out what kind of information is stored there.\nFor example, the database of your university would include a table named student, with all data regarding students, another table subject with information on the subjects at your university, etc.\nTables in databases look exactly the way you would imagine a normal table - they have columns and rows.\nColumns in every table have their names and they identify the kind of information is stored in them.\nEach row stores information about one object. In the student table below, you can see that the column names reflect the kind of data contained in them, so in the column name there are names of students, in the columns graduation_year there is the year of their graduation, etc.\nEach row corresponds to exactly one student.\n[ Insert table here ]\nNotation: Lets use the notation:\npet (id, name, owner_id)\nThe above means that we have a table named pet which has the following columns: id, name, and owner_id. This information will be enough for you to work with the tables in our exercise.\nSQL: So, how do we get in touch with our database? We use the so-called Structured Query Language. Of course, no one uses the full name, we just call it SQL for short.\nAll relational databases understand SQL, but each of them has a slightly different dialect, so to speak.\nThanks to SQL, you’ll be able to make queries in each database environment.\nQueries Just as the name suggests, queries are questions that we ask to find out some information about the data stored in the database.\nDatabases can do amazing things - they don’t only return the data you ask for, they can actually do advanced calculations on the tables. You’ll see for yourself!\nCoding  SELECT * FROM user;  SELECT tells your databases that you want to select data. FROM user tells the database to select data from the table user.\nFinally, the asterisk (*) tells the database you want to see all columns in this table.\nRemember that it’s good practice to always end your SQL command with a semicolon (;). A semicolon is like a period at the end of the sentence. It tells the database that you’re done with your command.\nFiltering Data Conditional Operators  OR\n AND\n BETWEEN\n Always check how BETWEEN works  NOT\n  We can also include even more conditions by using parentheses, according to our needs.\n LIKE\n Allows for the use of the percentage sign %  NOT NULL\n There can be NULL values, I.e. fields with unknown, missing values. To check whether a column has a value, we use a special instruction IS NOT NULL.   If you’re looking for null values…\n IS NULL  Remember, NULL is a special value. It means that some piece of information is missing or unknown.\nAlso, NULL = NULL is NEVER true in SQL!\nMathematical Operators You can:\n Add (+)\n Subtract (-)\n Multiply (*)\n Divide (/)\n  Multiple Tables In big databases we always use multiple tables. This also means that we often want to get data from more than one table at a time.\nJoining results from multiple tables Say we have two tables:\n Director (id, name, birth_year); Movie (id, title, production_year, director_id)  If we want data from both tables, we can simply do:\n SELECT * FROM movie, director;  How would the data be presented? There’s 8 movies, and 5 directors. Will it be 5? 8? Or will it get added together to be 13?\nThing is, none of those numbers are correct, we actually get 40 rows. The numbers multiply, 8 * 5 = 40. This is because SQL takes every single movie and joins it with every possible director.\nIn other words, SQL doesn’t know what to do with the results from the two tables, so it gave you every possible connection.\nHow can we change it? Take a look:\n /* Select everything from the database(s) */ SELECT * /* Data from certain one or more databases */ FROM movie, director /* Filter our responses, in this case, we merge related data so it doesn’t get bloated */ WHERE movie.director_id = director.id;  If you have multiple tables, you should refer to specific columns by giving the name of the table and the column, separated by a (.). As a result, the column director_id from the table movie becomes director.id and so on.\nNow the results look so much better! Joining multiple tables is such a popular and frequent operation that SQL provides a special word for it: JOIN. There are many versions of JOIN out there. For the time being, we’ll focus on the basic one.\nSQL must also know how to join the tables, so there is another keyword ON. After it, we set our condition: join only those rows where the id in director is the same as director_id in movie.\nThe code:\n SELECT * FROM movie /* We only select one table called movie, because we’ll JOIN it onto the director table */ JOIN director ON movie.director_id = director.id;  Rather than selecting everything now, lets say we select only a few columns. Here’s the code:\n /* “Filtering” out our results. */ SELECT director.name, movie.title /* Selecting only one table so that we can choose another to JOIN with */ FROM movie /* We are still joining the tables together */ JOIN director ON movie.director_id = director.id;  Omitting table names All together, these are good practices, but you only need to do it when there’s a chance of confusing them.\nIf there are two different columns with the same name in two different tables, then you have to specify the tables. If the name of the column is unique, though, you may omit the table name.\nLike in this code:\n SELECT name, title FROM movie JOIN director ON director.id = movie.director_id;  Renaming Columns Look at this code:\n SELECT director.id AS director_id, movie.id AS movie_id FROM movie JOIN director ON director.id = movie.director_id;  After the column name, e.g. director.id, we use the new keyword AS and we put the new name after it (director_id). We can repeat this process with every column.\nThe new name is just an alias, which means it’s temporary and doesn’t change the actual column name in the database. It only influences the way the column is shown in the result of the specific query.\nThis technique is often used when there are a few columns with the same name coming from different tables. Normally, when SQL displays columns in the result, there is no information about the table that a specific column in part of.\nFiltering the joined tables Code:\n SELECT * FROM movie JOIN director ON movie.director_id = director.id WHERE movie.production_year \u0026gt; 2000;  You can see, we just used WHERE again. Pretty simple. But, since we’re dealing with multiple tables, we specify it with movie.production_year. Although, it is quite unique to the movie table, that we can just omit the table name movie.\nStrings Example Code:\n SELECT * FROM movie JOIN director ON director.id = movie.director_id WHERE director.name = ’Steven Spielberg’;  Filtering with Strings.\nQuick fun example Here’s a fun problem you can try doing. Try it out, then look at the answers. Or… well don’t.\nSelect the title and production_year columns from the movie table, and the name and birth_year columns from the director table in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director. Show the column birth_year as born_in. Select only those movies which were filmed when their director was younger than 40 (i.e. the difference between production_year and birth_year must be less than 40).\nYour final code should look something like this:\u2028```\nSELECT title, production_year, name, birth_year AS born_in FROM movie JOIN director ON director.id = movie.director_id WHERE (production_year - birth_year) \u0026lt; 40;\n #### Another fun example Select the `id`, `title`, and `production_year` columns from the `movie` table, and the `name` and `birth_year` columns from the `director` table in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director. Show the column `birth_year` as `born_in` and the column `production_year` as `produced_in`. Select only those movies: - _Whose title contains a letter 'a' and which were filmed after 2000_,\u2028or - _Whose director was born between 1945 and 1995_. Your final code should look something like this:  SELECT title, production_year AS produced_in, movie.id, name, birth_year AS born_in FROM movie JOIN director ON director.id = movie.director_id WHERE (title LIKE \u0026lsquo;%a%\u0026rsquo; AND production_year \u0026gt; 2000) OR (birth_year BETWEEN 1945 AND 1995);\n```\n"
