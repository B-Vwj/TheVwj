      <description>Notes: An angle in &amp;lsquo;standard&amp;rsquo; position has its initial side on the positive x-axis and vertex at the origin point, (0,0).
Converting between degrees and radians: If the units of an angle is not specified, they&amp;rsquo;re assumed to be in radians.
 π radians = 180˚
 (π / 2) = 90˚
 (π / 3) = 60˚
 (π / 4) = 45˚

What is the circumference of the unit circle?
Circumference of a circle of radius &amp;lsquo;r&amp;rsquo; is 2πr.
Terms trigon: Greek for &amp;lsquo;triangle&amp;rsquo;.
metry (metric?): Greek for &amp;lsquo;measure&amp;rsquo;.
terminal point: The terminal point on the unit circle determined by the real number t.
To further explain terminal point, imagine that you&amp;rsquo;re standing on top of point (1,0) on the unit circle (the far right of the circle).</description>

      <description>Notes: If you look at the Unit Circle, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it starts at point (0,0), and then it ends after a period of 2π.
So a usual graph would begin at (0,0) and end at 2π. However, not all graphs do this.
A trigonometric graph would usually look like this:
f(x) = (a)sin(bx - c)
So&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s nice to know and all, but what things do we look for in a trigonometric graph?</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms Complex Numbers: i = √-1;  A complex number is a number of the form a + bi;  Where &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;b&amp;rsquo; are real numbers and i = √-1.
Extras How many times would the graph of the function f(x) = 2x2 - x + 5 cross the x-axis?
Answer:  The graph wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cross the x-axis, since intercepts are Real-Number Zeros and this function has no real number zeros.</description>

      <description>Notes: Theorems/Formulas Remember the Compound Interest Formula? (It&amp;rsquo;s alright if you didn&amp;rsquo;t, for now&amp;hellip;)
Here it is:
A = P(1 + (r/n))nt
Where&amp;hellip;
P =&amp;gt; Principal
r =&amp;gt; annual interest rate (as a decimal)
n =&amp;gt; number of compoundings in a year
t =&amp;gt; time in years
A =&amp;gt; accumulated value
Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a formula for Continuously Compounded Interest.
This means roughly that interest is compunded infinitely many times per year.</description>

      <description>The Law of Cosines The Law of Cosine can be used to solve triangles in 2 circumstances: - Given all 3 sides (SSS) - Given 2 sides and the included angle (SAS)
Example Given this triangle: [ Insert Screenshot image of triangle ]
With the triangle above, the coordinates of B are the hardest to find. We can find it with the formulas:
cos(A) = x/c = &amp;copy;cos(A) = x;</description>

Again, refer to my math problem generator if you need practice. Unless I either forgot or was just too lazy to make it.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric Inverse Functions</title>

      <description>Notes: Remember inverse functions?
 Inverse functions are one-to-one functions: f(x) and g(x) such that… f(g(x)) = x and g(f(x)) = x  Remember which functions had inverse functions?
 Only one-to-one functions have inverse functions. Remember that these are functions that pass the horizontal line test.  To define the inverse function of f(x) = sin(x), we pretty clear have a problem… The function fails the horizontal line test spectacularly!</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms Theorems Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:  Every Polynomial function has at least one complex number zero.
The Zeros Theorem:  A Polynomial function of degree &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; has exactly &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; zeros, provided that a zero of multiplicity &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo; is counted &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo; times.
Complex Zeros of polynomials with Real Numbers:
Let f(x) be a polynomial with real number coefficients { If &#39;a+bi&#39; is a zero of f(x), then a-bi is also a zero of f(x).</description>

      <description>Notes: This section was mostly just example problems. I will probably not add those problems onto this site here but rather instead, have them onto my Random Math equation generator. If I ever get that created, then I will post the link here.
If you&amp;rsquo;re seeing this message, I have been lazy and probably forgot about the project. Shoot me a message about it if you want on my Github or LinkedIn.</description>

      <description>Notes: Terms Rational Function is a function of the form:  R(x) = n(x)/d(x)  where n(x) and d(x) are polynomials.
Domain: Input &amp;lsquo;range&amp;rsquo; of x.
Range: Output &amp;lsquo;range&amp;rsquo; of y.
Y-axis: &amp;ldquo;Vertical Asymptote&amp;rdquo;
 Vertical Asymptote:  A Vertical Asymptote for a rational function is a line x=k;  Where &amp;lsquo;k&amp;rsquo; is a zero of the denominator of the function.  Example:
f(x) = (2x+5)/(x-2)  When x is close to 2, x-2 is close to 0, so dividing by a very small number, which gives us large numbers.</description>
